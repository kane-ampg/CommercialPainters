 * Site assessment booking schema.
 *
 * The site's one call to action is a free site assessment, so the form asks
 * what is needed to book one rather than what is needed to price a job: where
 * the site is, whether the visitor wants us there or on a call, when suits,
 * and how to reach them. Scope is a conversation, not a required essay.
 *
 * On-site visits are offered in metropolitan Melbourne only — that is the
 * area the business can evidence and staff. Everywhere else is offered an online
 * scoping call over Google Meet. The rule lives here, as a cross-field
 * refinement, so neither the form nor the chat can be talked around it.
 *
 * Shared by the client and the server. The server always re-validates; client
 * validation is a convenience, never a control.
