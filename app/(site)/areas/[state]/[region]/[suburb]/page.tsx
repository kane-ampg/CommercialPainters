/**
 * Suburb pages — 1,387 of them, one per locality in the merged dataset.
 *
 * Flat `{ state, region, suburb }` objects covering all three segments, which
 * is the documented shape for multiple dynamic segments; no parent chaining is
 * required. `dynamicParams = false` means anything outside this list is a real
 * 404 rather than a rendered page for a suburb we have no data for.
 *
 * Indexability comes from the data (`locality.indexable`), never from the
 * route: 16 of these are Tier 1. The other 1,371 are `noindex, follow` — they
 * must stay traversable, because the links out of them to the region hubs are
 * how the hubs earn their internal link equity.
