/**
 * The three claims the client asked for on 24 August 2026 — accreditations, Google
 * reviews, and the Bayswater North address — are the three most load-bearing
 * things on the site, and each of them has a specific way of going wrong:
 *
 *  - a Google review getting into `aggregateRating` markup,
 *  - a house-painting review landing on a commercial-only site,
 *  - a logo referenced from lib/site.ts that is not in `public/`,
 *  - and a "we are moving" notice that outlives the move.
 *
 * These are the tests for those four.
