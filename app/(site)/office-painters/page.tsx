  'An office repaint is scoped by how much of the floor can be released at once, not by floor area. A single open floor handed over for a weekend moves fast. The same area released as four zones across four weekends is the same amount of painting spread over four times the elapsed period, with four sets of set-up and pack-down inside it. Both are legitimate; they cost differently, and the difference should be visible before the choice is made.',
  'The equipment is rarely the problem — the personal effects are. Monitors, docks and cabling are straightforward to cover or move, but desks carrying papers, mugs, plants and framed photographs cannot be cleared by a painting crew without someone eventually asking where something went. A floor where staff have cleared their own desks before the programme starts runs measurably faster than one where they have not.',
  'Comms rooms, floor boxes and data cabling are treated as exclusion zones unless the IT team says otherwise. So are anything sprinkler-related and any device on a ceiling. Marking those out at the site assessment is quicker than discovering them at eleven at night with masking already up.',
  'Low-VOC systems are standard for occupied workplaces, but ventilation is what actually clears a floor before staff return. That ventilation window is a real constraint on the programme, and it is one of the main reasons larger floors are done across a weekend rather than overnight.',
