  'The order is not negotiable, and most delays come from getting it wrong. Structural and services work first, because everything after it gets damaged if it runs late. Wet trades ahead of painting — render, plaster and set — need drying time that cannot be compressed. Painting follows once the substrate is dry and prepared, and other trades that could mark a finished surface are scheduled to follow it rather than precede it.',
  'Drying time is the constraint people underestimate. Fresh render and new plasterboard set hold moisture, and coating over either before it has dried through traps that moisture behind the film. What follows is blistering, patchy sheen or adhesion failure a few months later — a defect that looks like bad paint and is actually a scheduling decision. In a Melbourne winter those drying windows are meaningfully longer than in summer, and the programme has to say so.',
  'Substrate preparation is a bigger line than most scopes allow for. New plasterboard needs its joints set and sanded flush before it will take a finish evenly, and surfaces already handled by other trades carry fixings, marks and patching that need bringing to a consistent, paintable surface. Getting that stage right is frequently more work than the coating that follows it, and it is the item most often under-scoped in a competing quote.',
  'What cannot be seen cannot be priced firm. Water damage, unstable render and previous poor repairs are usually hidden under a coating and only surface once preparation starts. The honest way to handle that is a labelled provisional sum against the areas that cannot be assessed until they are opened, with anything found reported and priced before it is carried out.',

              On commercial sites this matters more than it sounds. A finish held up waiting on the
              trade ahead of it is a zone the head contractor cannot hand over, and on a staged
              programme one delay moves everything behind it.
