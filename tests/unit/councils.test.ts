/**
 * Council notes.
 *
 * Two editorial rules from spec §6, both testable:
 *
 * 1. No claimed presence in Queensland. The business has no Queensland address,
 *    projects or phone number, so a QLD note may describe the place and how
 *    work is scoped there but never a footprint in it. The phrase list this
 *    checks against is `FORBIDDEN`, imported from tests/unit/qld-copy.test.ts
 *    rather than duplicated here — one list, one place to strengthen.
 * 2. Real writing, not a filled-in template. A note short enough to be a
 *    label is not differentiation.
