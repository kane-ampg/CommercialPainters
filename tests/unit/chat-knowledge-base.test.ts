/**
 * The chat knowledge base.
 *
 * `docs/chat-knowledge-base.md` is what a model will be grounded in once the
 * chat stops being purely scripted. A grounding document that has drifted from
 * the site is worse than none: it launders stale claims into confident answers.
 *
 * So the canonical facts are asserted to be present and correct, every verified
 * credential is asserted to be reproduced, and any credential that is *not*
 * verified is asserted to be listed as unsayable. This cannot check prose for
 * honesty — it can stop the specific drift that matters.
