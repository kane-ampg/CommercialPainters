      'Identifying the substrate and the existing coating comes before any specification. Concrete tilt panel, cement render, Colorbond and structural steel behave differently and fail differently, and an older site is frequently carrying two or three previous systems, some of which will not accept a modern topcoat. Coating over an unidentified existing film is the single most common cause of an industrial repaint failing early.',
      'Preparation is matched to what the assessment finds rather than to a default. Hot or cold pressure washing removes contamination and chalk, steam cleaning handles grease, and abrasion or chemical treatment is used where a film has to be keyed or removed. On steel, the standard of preparation determines how long the system lasts more than the product specified over it does.',
      'On industrial substrates the coating is usually doing a protective job rather than a decorative one. Steelwork is being protected from corrosion, concrete from water ingress and carbonation, cladding from UV degradation. That changes what a quote should be compared on — film build and system, not colour and coat count. Melbourne sites near the bay also sit in a more aggressive exposure than inland equivalents, and the specification should reflect it.',
      'Live operations shape the programme more than the painting does. Production runs, dispatch schedules, forklift and truck movement and roof access permits all constrain when an area can be worked, and large-format exteriors are usually staged elevation by elevation so one face is always clear for operations.',
