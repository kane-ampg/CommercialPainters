/**
 * The homepage fold, and the only hero on the site that claims a whole
 * viewport. `.hero-viewport` (globals.css) sizes it to exactly the space under
 * the sticky header, which is what puts the proof strip *on* the fold's bottom
 * edge rather than just below it. That edge is doing real work: it is the cue
 * that there is more page, on the one screen that has to carry the offer, both
 * audience paths, a way to call and a reason to believe any of it.
 *
 * The fold is a reel now, not a photograph. Twenty-nine seconds of the business's own
 * footage runs full-bleed behind the copy — Docklands from the air, the
 * branded vans on a shopping strip, an open-plan office being repainted around
 * the desks, a stairwell, a retail showroom — and the whole thing is the claim
 * in the headline demonstrated rather than asserted. Every shot in the cut is
 * commercial, and the cut ends where the master stops being so — the last
 * fifteen seconds are on the cutting-room floor for the same reason the page
 * they would have suited is gone. There is a unit test in tests/unit/ holding
 * that line across the source; this is the same rule applied to footage — and
 * it is enforced in scripts/encode-hero-video.mjs, which is where the cut
 * length is set.
 *
 * `HeroReel` owns the media, the scrim and the pause control. It takes this
 * copy as children so none of it becomes client JavaScript, and hands back one
 * value across the boundary: `--reel-progress`, which drives the red line on
 * the strip's top edge.
 *
 * Copy over footage is the arrangement the still version could not support. A
 * scrim heavy enough to carry white text at 360px wide left nothing of a
 * photograph, so the photograph got its own band instead. A cut that moves
 * survives the same scrim — there is always another frame — which is what lets
 * the fold finally be one image rather than two panels.
 *
 * Kept separate from `Hero` deliberately. Every other page wants a compact
 * header it can scroll past, and a shared component that did both would be
 * mostly branches.

/**
 * What we paint, as photographs first.
 *
 * This grid used to be five text-only cards, and it was the weakest block on
 * the site: the one section describing a visual trade with nothing visual in
 * it. The photographs are work in progress — a pole roller in an occupied
 * office, a boom lift against a warehouse wall — because a facilities manager
 * reads competence off the set-up, the sheeting and the access equipment, not
 * off a finished wall that any painter can photograph.
 *
 * It is no longer an even three-column grid, for two reasons. Five services
 * into three columns left an orphan row of two, and the identical
 * `sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` shape runs three times down the homepage —
 * here, then the sectors, then the projects. So the first service leads at the
 * full width of the row with its photograph taking half the card, and the
 * remaining four run beneath it, four across.
 *
 * Nothing is hidden behind an interaction. A carousel would have put three of
 * the five services behind a click on the one section that answers what the
 * company actually does, and the page already carries one at the review wall.
 *
 * The lead is `services[0]` rather than a slug named here, so reordering
 * content/services.ts is what changes which service gets the large card.
 *
 * Cards are not links. Services do not each have a page, so the frame carries
 * the house photo zoom and nothing else that would imply somewhere to click;
 * `image` stays optional so a service without a photograph still renders as
 * the plain card it used to be.

/**
 * One photograph and the claim it evidences, on a full-bleed slab.
 *
 * For the pages that carry long sequencing copy and nothing to break it with.
 * The caption is where the photograph is explained rather than captioned: a
 * process shot only earns its place if it shows the thing the surrounding
 * paragraphs are claiming, and the caption is what ties the two together.
 *
 * Which is why this is a two-part spread and not a picture with a label under
 * it. The caption used to be `text-sm` at 70% white on its own line under a
 * full-width frame, with most of a screen of empty black beside it — typeset
 * as a label, orphaned as a composition, and carrying the page's actual
 * argument while looking like an afterthought. Now the photograph takes seven
 * columns and the claim takes five, the two are locked on a shared bottom
 * line, and the air above the caption is the margin of a spread rather than a
 * hole. The rule over the caption is what makes that read as intentional: it
 * defines the column the text sits at the foot of.
 *
 * Wider than the reading measure on purpose — a band the same width as the
 * text reads as an illustration inside the argument, and this is meant to be a
 * pause in it.
 *
 * `tone` matters more here than anywhere else on the site, because interior
 * trade photography is overwhelmingly high-key: white walls, white partitions,
 * white shirts, and a ceiling full of blown highlights. Put one of those on
 * `paper` or `sunken` and the photograph has no edge — its corners are within
 * a few values of the page behind them and the whole band reads as a pale
 * smear. `ink` is the tone for those, and it does the work no amount of
 * grading would: the surround supplies the contrast the photograph does not
 * have, and the same picture reads as a lit panel.
 *
 * `aspect` defaults to the 3:2 these photographs are shot at, i.e. no crop at
 * all. It was `21/9`, which centre-cropped a 3:2 frame down to its emptiest
 * horizontal band: the ceiling and the drop-sheeted floor went, and what was
 * left was a blank wall with the tradesman pushed against one edge. A crop
 * that discards the evidence defeats the caption above. Anything passed here
 * should be a ratio the photograph was actually composed for.
 *
 * The frame carries an inset hairline. Sitting inside the rounded corner
 * rather than around it, it is the one edge that survives both cases — a pale
 * photograph needs no help against the ink, but the dark quarter of the same
 * picture does.

/**
 * An ordered run of stages. Shared by the homepage and /commercial/ so the two
 * cannot drift into describing the same process differently.
 *
 * Rendered as an <ol> because the order is the content — these are not
 * interchangeable features. It is drawn as a rail for the same reason: this was
 * a three-column card grid, which put the stages in a zigzag reading order and
 * sat the last one beside a hole, and which made a sequence look exactly like
 * the four unordered card grids surrounding it on the page. A process has a
 * direction; nothing else in these sections does, and now nothing else looks
 * like it.
 *
 * The stages stand on one rule, and a red line runs the length of it on a loop
 * — drawing from Enquiry to Handover, lighting each stage's glyph as it reaches
 * it, then clearing and going again. The loop is the same gesture as the fold
 * seam in the hero. See `.process-rail` in app/globals.css for the timing and
 * for why the rule's resting state is a fully drawn line.
 *
 * It runs on wall-clock time, not on scroll: `InView` pauses it whenever the
 * rail is off screen, so it plays for exactly as long as it is being looked at
 * and costs nothing the rest of the time. Scroll-linking it meant a reader who
 * stopped moving got a half-drawn line, and a reader who flicked past got the
 * whole sequence in three frames — neither of which is the sequence.
 *
 * The rule is horizontal from `lg`, with the numerals and glyphs standing on
 * it; below that it rotates into the left gutter and the stages stack beside
 * it. One relationship, two orientations — a timeline reads the same way turned
 * on its side, and a five-across rail does not survive a phone.
