 * Sector indexation follows evidence, the same way suburb tiers do.
 *
 * Five of the eight sector pages document no completed project. Those pages
 * used to be index,follow and sitemap-listed while their own body copy said
 * they were placeholders — the thinnest possible signal to send about a page.
 * The rule is now computed in one place from the same predicate on both
 * surfaces: a sector without a documented project is `noindex, follow` and
 * stays out of the sitemap, exactly like a Tier 3 suburb. Documenting a
 * project flips both automatically.
