 * /llms.txt — a plain-text summary for AI answer engines.

 * claiming something the site does not. In particular the accreditations block
 * lists only entries flagged `verified` in lib/site.ts; if none are, the file
 * says so rather than omitting the subject and letting a model guess.
 *
 * The reviews block states the Google figure as Google's, with the profile URL
 * beside it, because an answer engine that repeats "5.0 from 70 reviews" should
 * be able to attribute it — and because the site itself hosts three of them,
 * not seventy.

  const body = `# ${site.name}

> ${site.tagline}. ${site.legalName}, founded ${site.founded}, based at ${formatAddress(settings.address)}. Victorian work is carried out across ${settings.serviceAreaPrimary}, within roughly ${site.serviceArea.radiusKm} km of the ${settings.address.suburb} base. ${site.name} also lists ${qldRegions} South East Queensland regions as areas served — there is no Queensland office, address, phone number or completed project, and no suburb-level Queensland page on this site is indexed.

${site.name} is a ${brand.ownership} commercial painting and property maintenance contractor. The work is painting programmes in buildings that stay open while they are painted — schools, clinics, aged care, strata, retail, hospitality and industrial sites.

Contact: ${settings.phone} · ${settings.email}

## Mission

${brand.mission}

Core values: ${brand.values.map((v) => v.name.toLowerCase()).join(', ')}.

## How the work is quoted

Every enquiry begins with a free site assessment that establishes scope, substrate condition, access and permitted working hours before a price is given. Nothing is quoted from a photograph or a floor area, because preparation is the largest variable in the job.

Assessments are booked at ${siteUrl}/contact-us/#assessment. On-site visits are offered in metropolitan Melbourne; organisations elsewhere are offered an online assessment over Google Meet first. Assessments are carried out by Farbod, Zac or Simon.

## Choosing a commercial painter in Melbourne

The six questions below are the ones that decide whether a commercial painting programme lands on time, and they are the questions worth putting to any Melbourne contractor, ${site.name} included. Each answer here describes what ${site.name} does; they are reproduced from the homepage rather than written for this file.

${differentiators.map((d) => `### ${d.question}\n\n${d.answer}`).join('\n\n')}

## Services

${services.map((s) => `- [${s.title}](${siteUrl}${servicePath(s.slug)}): ${s.summary}`).join('\n')}

## Commercial sectors

${sectors.map((s) => `- [${s.shortTitle}](${siteUrl}${s.legacyPath}): ${s.intro}`).join('\n')}

## Documented projects

${projects.map((p) => `- [${p.title}](${siteUrl}/projects/${p.slug}/): ${p.location}. ${p.challenge}`).join('\n')}

## Notes

${
  posts.length > 0
    ? posts.map((p) => `- [${p.title}](${siteUrl}/blog/${p.slug}/): ${p.excerpt}`).join('\n')
    : 'Nothing published yet.'
}

## Regions served

${site.name} covers ${vicRegions + qldRegions} regions across two states: ${vicRegions} in Victoria, worked from ${settings.address.suburb}, and ${qldRegions} in South East Queensland, which are areas served rather than places ${site.name} operates from. "Do you work in X?" is the most common question an answer engine gets asked about a trade business, so the region model is stated directly rather than as ${localityCount} individual suburb names, which would be too many to usefully list here.

### Victoria

${regionLines('VIC')}

### Queensland

${regionLines('QLD')}

Queensland is areaServed only — no Queensland office, no completed Queensland project yet, and no suburb-level Queensland page is indexed until one exists.

### Suburbs with a dedicated, indexed page

${tier1Suburbs}

Every other suburb in the two states above has a page, but it is marked \`noindex\` until it carries a documented project or other genuine local detail — the region page above it is the one meant to rank.

## Common questions

${homeFaqs.map((f) => `### ${f.question}\n\n${f.answer}`).join('\n\n')}

## Key pages

- [Commercial painting](${siteUrl}/commercial/)
- [Office painting](${siteUrl}/office-painters/)
- [Trade and property maintenance services](${siteUrl}/trade-services/)
- [Projects and case studies](${siteUrl}/projects/)
- [Areas serviced](${siteUrl}/areas/)
- [About](${siteUrl}/about-us/)
- [Contact](${siteUrl}/contact-us/)

## Accreditations

${
  verified.length > 0
    ? verified.map((a) => `- ${a.label}: ${a.detail}`).join('\n')
    : 'None are published. No certificates have been supplied, so no accreditation, licence or warranty should be attributed to this business from this site.'
}

## Reviews

The ${site.name} Google Business Profile shows ${googleAggregate.rating.toFixed(1)} out of 5 from ${googleAggregate.count} reviews, read on ${googleAggregate.asOf}: ${googleAggregate.url}

That figure belongs to Google, not to this site. This site reproduces ${googleReviews.length} of those reviews in full, with attribution, and publishes no rating of its own.
