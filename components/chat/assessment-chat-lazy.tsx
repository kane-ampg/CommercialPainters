 * Defers the floating site assessment chat.

 * AssessmentChat was statically imported by the root layout, which put its entire
 * client module graph — the zod runtime, the chat flow and the chat FAQ
 * content — into the first-load JavaScript of every page on the site. The
 * full forms on /contact-us/ are the primary, no-JavaScript route (the layout
 * says so where it renders this), so the chat is exactly the "defer until
 * needed" case: it loads as its own chunk once the browser is idle, after
 * hydration and the LCP have had the bandwidth.
