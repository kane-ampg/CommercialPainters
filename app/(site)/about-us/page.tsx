        <Prose>
          <p>
            {site.legalName} was founded in {site.founded} with two aims: to do painting work
            properly, and to look after the clients who commissioned it. The team brings around 30
            years of combined industry experience to the work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The approach has stayed the same. Do the job properly, hold the standard, and run
            projects in a way that is organised and easy to work alongside. That has produced
            long-term relationships and repeat work across a broad range of clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today we run multiple projects across Melbourne at once while keeping the finish and the
            service consistent. Whether it is a single tenancy or a larger commercial or industrial
            programme, the same care and attention goes in.
