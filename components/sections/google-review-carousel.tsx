/**
 * The Google reviews, as a carousel.
 *
 * ## Why a scroll container rather than a transform
 *
 * The track is a genuinely scrolling element with CSS scroll snapping, and
 * every move — autoplay, arrows, dots — is a `scrollTo`. That buys touch
 * swiping, trackpad flicks, keyboard arrow keys and a sane reading order for
 * nothing, and it means the component holds no offset of its own that can drift
 * out of step with what is on screen: position is read back off `scrollLeft`
 * rather than remembered.
 *
 * It also degrades honestly. Before hydration — or if the bundle never arrives
 * — the section is a swipeable row of readable cards, which is a perfectly good
 * reviews wall. None of this is required for the content to be there.
 *
 * ## Where a card is allowed to stop
 *
 * Three cards are visible at `lg`, two at `sm`, one below that, and that count
 * is never named in JavaScript. `stops` is measured off the laid-out cards, so
 * the breakpoints live in the class list alone. Offsets that clamp to the same
 * final scroll position collapse into one, which is why the last two dots do
 * not exist on desktop — a dot that cannot move anything misrepresents what the
 * control does.
 *
 * ## When it moves by itself
 *
 * Every five seconds, and it holds still for any of five reasons: a mouse over
 * the carousel, keyboard focus inside it, the section scrolled off screen, a
 * backgrounded tab, or the visitor pressing pause. `prefers-reduced-motion`
 * suppresses autoplay outright, and the pause control with it — there is
 * nothing left to stop, and the arrows still work.
 *
 * Content that advances by itself past five seconds needs a way to stop it
 * (WCAG 2.2.2), which is the pause button. Hover and focus are the two that
 * matter in practice, because they are what someone does while reading.
