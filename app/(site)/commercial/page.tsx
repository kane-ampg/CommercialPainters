          <p>
            We deliver interior and exterior painting for commercial and industrial sites across
            Melbourne — from tenancy repaints and{' '}
            <Link href="/office-painters/" className="font-semibold text-brand-700 hover:underline">
              office repaints and fit-outs
            </Link>{' '}
            through to large-format building exteriors. Projects range from a two-person, two-day
            job through to programmes requiring boom lifts, scissor lifts, scaffolding and roof
            rigging.
          </p>
          <p>
            The harder projects need surface knowledge more than they need labour. Older buildings
            need existing coatings identified and the substrate properly assessed before anything is
            specified. Preparation is matched to what we find — hot or cold power washing, steam
            cleaning, sandblasting, abrasion or chemical treatment where required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the sites we work on stay open throughout. That is the constraint that shapes
            everything else: how zones are isolated, when work happens, and how each area is handed
            back.
