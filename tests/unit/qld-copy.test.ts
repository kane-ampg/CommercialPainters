 * The class of defect a phrase list cannot catch.

 * worst Queensland claim on the site, because that claim contained none of its
 * phrases: the facts card printed "0.0km from Brisbane — a drive of under 20
 * minutes" on every Queensland suburb page. No base was named, so the drive
 * band read as the business's mobilisation time to that suburb — the strongest presence
 * implication anywhere on the site — and on 542 pages the distance was a
 * tautology besides ("0.5km from Gold Coast", on Southport).
 *
 * A phrase list could not see it because the sentence is assembled from data at
 * render time. So this renders the component instead, over every Queensland
 * locality, and asserts the absence of the *shape*: no distance, no drive band,
 * no travel-time unit. Any future edit that puts a QLD page's distance back —
 * however it is worded — fails here.
