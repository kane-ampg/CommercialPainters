 * hands the square mark roughly twice the visual mass of its neighbours.
 * Height therefore falls as the mark gets wider, on the fourth root of the
 * aspect ratio: that lands between equal-height (which over-weights the square
 * mark) and equal-area (which over-weights it the other way, because a
 * wordmark is mostly the whitespace between letters).
 *
 * Derived from the mark's own intrinsic dimensions rather than tuned per file,
 * so a fifth accreditation drops in without anyone re-measuring the row.

 * One strip of painter's masking tape.
 *
 * Two of these hold each accreditation card to the black ground, at opposite
 * corners, angled the same way — the way one hand would actually tape a notice
 * up. Each strip runs off its corner onto the footer, which is the detail that
 * sells it: tape stopping at the card edge reads as a printed border, tape
 * running past it reads as tape.
 *
 * 22 degrees, and no steeper. A strip laid across the corner at 45 was the
 * first attempt and is the more obvious version of this, but at that angle its
 * bounding box runs about 1.6rem past the corner — wider than the gap between
 * cards at every breakpoint — so every strip landed on its neighbour. At 22
 * the sideways reach stays inside the gap while the strip still reads as tape
 * rather than as a label sitting level with the edge. Vertical clearance is
 * free, since the row has py-10 around it; horizontal clearance is not.
 *
 * Colour, grain and translucency live in `.tape-strip` in globals.css, and the
 * torn ends in the two `.tape-torn-*` variants beside it. Only geometry is set
 * here.
 *
 * Purely decorative, so `aria-hidden` and `pointer-events-none`: the credential
 * itself is carried by the logo's alt text and the visually-hidden detail line.

/**
 * Accreditations, as a logo wall.
 *
 * Only entries flagged `verified` in lib/site.ts are presented as credentials,
 * and only the four that carry a mark get a logo — the screening checks are
 * held per person, so badging them would imply a company-level certification
 * that does not exist. They are stated in words on the about page instead.
 *
 * Each mark sits on its own white chip. The four supplied files do not agree
 * on a background — MPA is transparent, the Dulux badge has white baked in and
 * Haymes a solid blue box — so dropping them straight onto the ink ground
 * would show the boxes. The chip normalises that, and it has to be true white
 * rather than a tinted off-white, or the Dulux badge's baked-in white shows as
 * a seam inside its own chip.
 *
 * Five marks, which no column count divides evenly, so this is a centred
 * wrapping row rather than a grid: an orphan on the last line sits under the
 * middle of the line above and reads as deliberate, where a grid would push it
 * hard against one edge. The three max-widths then fix where it breaks instead
 * of leaving it to the viewport — 2 + 2 + 1 on phones, 3 + 2 on tablets, all
 * five across from 1024. Each is the exact width of that many chips plus their
 * gaps, so the row cannot break anywhere unintended.
 *
 * Chips are h-20 with a fixed width, so every mark gets the same frame however
 * wide it is. Both are kept tight on purpose: give them more room and the
 * white reads as the element and the logo as an afterthought floating in it.
 *
 * Square corners, per the borderRadius override in tailwind.config.ts: the
 * whole system is flat slabs and hard rules, and a softened chip here would be
 * the only rounded thing on the page.
 *
 * In colour, not greyscale: a faded accreditation badge reads as decoration,
 * and these are the strongest trust signal on the site.
 *
 * If nothing is verified the bar renders the gap rather than disappearing:
 * a silently empty trust bar looks identical to a business with no credentials.
