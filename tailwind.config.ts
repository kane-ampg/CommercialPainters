       * changing — anything above ~250ms or ~8px starts to feel like waiting.
       * One shared ease (a decelerating curve, the CSS equivalent of GSAP's
       * power2.out used by ScrollReveal) so the whole surface moves alike.
       *
       * No fill mode, for two reasons. A forwards fill would leave a transform
       * permanently applied to every bubble in the transcript, making each one
       * a containing block for the rest of the session to no purpose. And with
       * no fill an element that never animates — motion disabled, a future
       * override, an animation that simply does not start — renders at its
       * normal, visible style rather than at a keyframe's `opacity: 0`. That is
       * the rule ScrollReveal follows too: nothing is hidden while waiting on
       * motion to happen. The cost is a possible single-frame flash of the
       * settled state, which at 6px and 220ms is not perceptible.
