/**
 * The homepage fold's background reel.
 *
 * This owns the moving layer and nothing else: the fold's copy and its proof
 * strip are passed straight through as `children` so they stay server
 * components. The only thing crossing the boundary is `--reel-progress`, set on
 * this element and read by the red cut line on the strip's top edge.
 *
 * ## What actually renders first
 *
 * The poster, always, as a preloaded, `fetchpriority=high` next/image — it is
 * the LCP element and it paints before a byte of video is requested. The
 * `<video>` never exists on the server: it appears on the first render after
 * hydration and fades over the poster once it can play. The poster is the
 * reel's own first frame, so the swap is invisible.
 *
 * Deferring the element that far is what makes the three exits below possible,
 * and it is also how the 720p and 1080p encodes get chosen without relying on
 * `media` on `<source>`, which browsers have never agreed on.
 *
 * ## When the video does not load at all
 *
 * - `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`. Twenty-nine seconds of hard cuts is
 *   exactly the content that setting exists to refuse.
 * - `navigator.connection.saveData`. An explicit ask not to be charged for
 *   decoration.
 * - Autoplay refused by the browser. Nothing is retried and no play button is
 *   forced on the visitor; the poster is a complete hero on its own.
 *
 * In all three the fold renders identically apart from the movement — same
 * crop, same scrim, same contrast — because everything legibility depends on
 * sits above the media layer rather than being baked into it.
 *
 * ## While it plays
 *
 * An IntersectionObserver pauses the video the moment the fold leaves the
 * screen and resumes it on the way back. The page below is long; a decoded
 * 1080p stream running behind eight sections nobody can see it through is pure
 * battery. The progress loop is rAF-driven and is torn down with it, so a
 * scrolled-past hero costs nothing at all.
 *
 * WCAG 2.2.2 requires a way to stop motion that runs past five seconds, so the
 * toggle in the top-right corner is a requirement rather than a flourish.
 * Pausing by hand is remembered against the observer — scrolling away and back
 * will not restart a reel the visitor stopped.
