 * every VIC locality's `distanceKm` is measured from it, and "a drive of 20 to
 * 40 minutes" is the thing a facilities manager is actually asking about.
 *
 * In Queensland it was neither true nor even coherent. The QLD anchor labels
 * are region names, so `/areas/queensland/brisbane-inner/brisbane-city/` read
 * "0.0km from Brisbane — a drive of under 20 minutes" and Southport read
 * "0.5km from Gold Coast": a tautology on 542 pages and a bare proximity claim
 * on the other 370. Worse, no base was named, so "a drive of under 20 minutes"
 * read as the business's mobilisation time to that suburb — the strongest presence
 * implication anywhere on the site, and false. The business has no Queensland address,
 * crew or phone number.
 *
 * So Queensland gets a different fourth fact, one that is true: how the business
 * services the suburb, and the absence a reader needs in order to read the rest
 * of the page correctly. No distance, no drive time, no anchor.
 * tests/unit/qld-copy.test.ts renders this card for every Queensland locality
 * and fails if any distance or drive-time phrasing reappears.
