/**
 * The homepage differentiation grid names things: Cm3, Master Painters
 * Australia, Dulux, Emmaus College, the Noble Park factory, eleven NDIS
 * offices. That is the whole point of the rewrite — an unnamed claim is not
 * differentiation and is not citable — but it puts the copy one unverified
 * credential away from asserting something the business cannot back.
 *
 * These tests are the guard. Each card declares which accreditations and
 * projects its prose leans on; if one loses its `verified` flag or is renamed,
 * the build fails here rather than shipping a claim nobody can support.
