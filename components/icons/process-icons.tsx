/**
 * Process glyphs.
 *
 * One mark per stage of "How a job runs", drawn on the same 24x24 grid and with
 * the same stroke treatment as the sector glyphs — a second icon set that
 * looked like a different hand would be worse than no icons at all.
 *
 * They exist for one reason: the rail is five near-identical text columns, and
 * a reader skimming it has nothing to fix on between "Enquiry" and "Handover".
 * A glyph gives each stage a silhouette, and — because each one acts out its
 * stage as the red line reaches it — lets the sequence be read at a glance
 * rather than word by word.
 *
 * ## Each glyph performs its own stage
 *
 * The message writes itself, the pin drops onto ground that redraws under it,
 * the quote and the compliance tick are written, the roller runs and lays its
 * band of paint, and the key turns in the lock. The moving parts are marked
 * with `glyph-*` classes; `.process-rail__glyph` in app/globals.css owns the
 * timing, and every one of those animations is written to end exactly where it
 * started, so it can loop forever without a reset frame.
 *
 * ## Nothing here depends on the animation running
 *
 * Every glyph is drawn complete and legible at rest: the writing is written,
 * the tick is ticked, the key is whole. A reader who asked for less motion, or
 * an engine that ignores the keyframes, gets a finished icon rather than an
 * empty one. That is why the sweeps are dash *offsets* over a fully drawn path
 * rather than a `stroke-dasharray` that starts hidden — there is no state in
 * this file that only JavaScript or a keyframe can undo.
